# healthyrecipeapp

It's a website to create, add and share healthy recipes.

You are able to publish your own recipes and view ones published by others.
Each recipe will get a unique recipeID.
Clicking on the create button will push the recipe into the database and save it.
If you want to create a recipe you have to give it a name, a description, estimated preparation+cooking time
and a difficulty rating of "easy", "medium", "hard" or "professional".
The order of recipes is by ID, so the ones that were published earlier will be shown first.
